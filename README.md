The Jupyter notebooks represent the PySpark code used to build the Text Classifier graph model. There are local implementations as well as an implementation using the Databricks community edition.

The QlikView (.QVW) files are used to visually interact with the built models.

The RapidMiner folder contains details of the files used to test against the same corpora using kNN and SVM models.
